first of all um there's there's two different things there's like what do we understand today yeah what could the human mind understand and what is the totality of what is there to be understood yeah right and so there's three consensus you know you can think of them as three larger and larger trees or exploring more branches of that tree and i i think with ai we're going to explore that whole lot now the question is is uh you know if you think about what is the totality of what could be understood um there may be some fundamental physics quite small giving our cognitive limitations limited cognitive capabilities that even with with the tools we build we still won't be able to understand a lot of things and that's perhaps what non-human systems might be able to reach farther not just as

still keep adding to so um and and that's how i think the beginning of an explanation would look and it would start encompassing many of the mysteries that we have wondered about for thousands of years like you know consciousness uh life and gravity all of these things yeah giving us a glimpses of explanations for those things yeah well um \\n>>> i used to discuss um uh uh what were the sort of founding tenets of deep mind \\n... algorithmic advances so deep learning you know jeff hinton and cohen just had just sort of invented that in academia but no one in industry knew about it \\n... we love reinforcement learning \\n... understanding about the human brain had advanced um quite a lot uh in the decade prior with fmri machines and other things \\n... \\n... the other big things were compute and gpus right so we could see a compute was going to be really useful \\n... \\n... the final thing was also mathematical and theoretical definitions of intelligence so i used to discuss um

that in academia but no one in industry knew about it uh we love reinforcement learning we thought that could be scaled up but also understanding about the human brain had advanced um quite a lot uh in the decade prior with fmri machines and other things so we could get some good hints about architectures and algorithms and and sort of um representations maybe that the brain uses so as at a systems level not at a implementation level um and then the other big things were compute and gpus right so we could see a compute was going to be really useful and it got to a place where it became commoditized mostly through the games industry and and that could be taken advantage of and then the final thing was also mathematical and theoretical definitions of intelligence so i used to discuss
