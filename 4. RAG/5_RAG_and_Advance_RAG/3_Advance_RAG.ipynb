could just play against itself from random starting point from the beginning \\nso that removed the the need for human knowledge uh about go \\nand then finally alpha zero then generalized it so that any things we had in there the system including things like symmetry of the go board \\nuh were removed so the alpha zero could play from scratch any two player game call them alpha x projects right is and the easiest way to see that is the evolution of alphago to alpha zero \\nalphago was um a learning system but it was specifically trained to only play go \\nso uh and what we wanted to do with first version of go is just get to world champion performance no matter how we did it right \\nand then and then of course alphago zero we we we removed the need to use human games as a starting point right \\nso it could just play against itself from random starting point from the beginning \\nso the alpha zero could play from scratch any two player game \\nand then mu0 which is the final latest version of that set of things was then extending it so that you didn't even have to give it the rules of the game it would learn that for itself so it could >>\\nold-fashioned ai we would call it now

       "'The main topics discussed in the context are:\\n\\n*   **Evolution of AlphaGo to AlphaZero and MuZero:** The discussion covers the progression of AlphaGo, starting as a system trained to play Go, to AlphaZero, which could play any two-player game from scratch, and finally MuZero, which could learn the rules of a game itself. This evolution highlights advancements in learning systems and removing the need for human knowledge and predefined rules [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].\\n\\n*   **Founding of DeepMind and Early AI Debates:** The context touches upon the early days of DeepMind, the challenges in securing funding in 2010, and debates with figures from \"old-fashioned AI\" like Minsky and Patrick Winston, who doubted the potential of learning systems [11, 12, 13, 14].\\n\\n*   **Day in the Life and Habits of Researchers:** There\\'s a segment that asks about daily routines, including wake-up times, habits, coffee consumption, computer setups, and preferred text editors (Emacs/Vim), and how the perfect day has changed over time from intense individual research and programming to include other activities [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22].\\n\\n*   **AI and Fundamental Questions in Physics/Philosophy:** The discussion explores how AI might help address fundamental questions like the nature of time and the computational nature of the universe, by allowing for open-minded exploration without making hard assumptions and by building experimental tools to test theories [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32].\\n\\n**Citations:**\\n\\n[1] \"call them alpha x projects right is and the easiest way to see that is the evolution of alphago to alpha zero so alphago was um a learning system but it was
