I recently purchased the Moto G35 as a secondary phone, and I must say, I'm totally satisfied with it. For the price, it's a great value. The phone performs smoothly, and the display is crisp and vibrant—definitely above expectations in this segment.
The camera is decent and gets the job done for everyday snaps. One of the pleasant surprises was finding a charger included in the box, which is rare these days. The battery backup is impressive for light usage, easily lasting through the day without any issues.
Sound quality is also surprisingly good, making media consumption enjoyable. Overall, if you're looking for a budget-friendly, reliable secondary phone, the Moto G35 is a solid choice Review by Nanvneet Shukla.
